What is stored in a persistent session?

Note : messages are stored in memoey not on disk
------------------------------------------------------------
In a persistent session, the broker stores the following information (even if the client (subscriber) is offline). When the client(subscriber) reconnects the information is available immediately.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
All the subscriptions of the client.
All messages in a Quality of Service (QoS) 1 or 2 flow that the client has not yet confirmed.
All new QoS 1 or 2 messages that the client missed while offline (client --> subscriber)
All QoS 2 messages received from the client that are not yet completely acknowledged (pub/sub)

Persistant session/Non Persistant Session: 
-------------------------------------------------
When the client connects to the broker, it can request a persistent session. The client uses a cleanSession flag to tell the broker what kind of session it needs

When the clean session flag is set to true, the client does not want a persistent session. If the client disconnects for any reason, all information and messages that are queued from a previous persistent session are lost.

When the clean session flag is set to false, the broker creates a persistent session for the client. All information and messages are preserved until the next time, client requests a clean session. 

If the clean session flag is set to false and the broker already has a session available for the client, it uses the existing session and delivers previously queued messages to the client.


Persistent session on the client side (Pub/sub)
-----------------------------------------------------------------
Similar to the broker, each MQTT client must also store a persistent session. When a client requests the server to hold session data, the client is responsible for storing the following information:

All messages in a QoS 1 or 2 flow, that are not yet confirmed by the broker.
All QoS 2 messages received from the broker that are not yet completely acknowledged.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Note:

If the subscriber connects to the broker with "clean session" to false, the broker saves all subscriptions and all messages only if the client is offline. It's like a queue but not a very queue. With "clean session" false, if the client goes offline but some publishers send messages to topic it is subscribed, the broker store these messages. When the client returns online, it will receive all messages lost.
